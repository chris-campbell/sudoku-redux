# Sudoku Application w/Redux State Management

Sudoku Redux is a application inspired by a techical interview I had back in December of 2021. I was tasked to create a valid move function for a Sudoku game. I wasn't very happy with my performance so I decided to build out this application with React + Redux & TypeScript.

## Get Application running:

Install dependencies

### `npm install`

### `npm start`
